1. Factors that contribute to EUI would be location. In ward that are more affluent (e.g. wards who have a lower poverty rate and unemployment rate) tend to have a lower energy intensity. While wards who have a higher poverty and unemployment rate tend to use more energy. This is also seen through water usage by more affluent areas consuming more water while disenfranchised areas are shown to use less. 

2.Yes there is a direct correlation. As the wards become more impoverished, the site EUI increases therefore increasing the Greenhouse gas emmision.

4. Ratios, averages, and graphs are in the excel sheet
